Whole song is G C D with slidey bits in between.
Bracketed chords are optional.

VERSE
G                             C
I pulled into Nashville, Tennessee
(C# slide) D                         (C)  G
but you wouldn't even come around to see me

And since your headin' up to Carolina
You know I'm gonna be right there behind you

CHORUS

Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I love to feel that warm southern rain
just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
And to see it fall on your simple country dress 
it's like heaven to me I must confess

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
G  F (slide) G

Now I've been hangin around you for days
but when I lean in you just turn your head away
Oh no you didn't mean that
She said I love the way you think but I hate the way you act

REPEAT CHORUS no guitar
