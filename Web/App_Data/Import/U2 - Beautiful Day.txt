INTRO    A   Bm   D    G    D   A

VERSE
               A   Bm   D    G         D                     A
The heart is a bloom           Shoots  up  through the stony ground 
There's no room               No  space  to rent in this town 
You're out of luck               And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck             And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found   a friend     To take you out  of  this  place 
Someone you   could  lend    a hand         In return   for   grace

CHORUS
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5                   A5
It's a beautiful day                      Sky   falls,   you feel  like
It's a beautiful day                      Don't let  it   get  away

VERSE
You're on the road             But you've got   no  destination
You're in the mud              In the maze of her  imagination
You love this town             Even if that   doesn't ring true
You've been all over           And it's been   all   over you

REPEAT CHORUS

POST CHORUS
F#m          G        D               A
Touch    me           Take me to that other  place
Teach    me           I know I'm not a hopeless case

A   Bm   D    G    D   A

BRIDGE
Em              G                      D           A
See the world   in green and blue     See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night   See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth 
after the flood all the colors came out

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT POST CHORUS

A                        Bm           D       G
 What  you  don't  have  you  don't   need it now  
 What  you  don't  know  you can feel   it somehow   
 What  you  don't  have  you  don't   need it now
 Don't  need  it  now

 Was a beautiful day
