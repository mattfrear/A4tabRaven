 G
It's another tequila sunrise
 D                        Am   D7       G                     
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky,  said goodbye

He was just a hired hand
Workin on the dreams he planned to try,  the days go by

CHORUS
 Em                  C      
Every night when the sun goes down
 Em          C             Em
Just another lonely boy in town
    Am               D7
And she's out runnin' round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on,  it's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends,  it never ends

BRIGDE
Am          D
Take another shot of courage
Bm             E               Am    B              Em7  A
Wonder why the right words never come,  you just get numb 

It's another tequila sunrise
This old world still looks the same,  another frame
