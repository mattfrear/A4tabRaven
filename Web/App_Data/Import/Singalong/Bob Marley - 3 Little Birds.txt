BOB MARLEY - 3 LITTLE BIRDS
A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

CHORUS 
      A      
Don't worry about a thing
      D                               A
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singin' don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

VERSE
              A
Rise up this morning
                 E
Smile with the rising sun
             A
Three little birds
           D
Sit by my doorstep
          A
Singing sweet songs
            E
Of melodies pure and true
         D                     A
Singin' this is my message to you-ou-ou
