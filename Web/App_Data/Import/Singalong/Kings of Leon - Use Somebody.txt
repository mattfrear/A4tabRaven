(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I've been roaming around, Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody...
you know that I could use somebody...

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
countless lovers under cover of the streets

You know that I could use somebody...
you know that I could use somebody...

Someone like you

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [wha-ah-ah]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [wha-ah-ah]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
waging wars to shape the poet and the beat

I hope it's going to make you notice...
I hope it's going to make you notice...

Someone like me...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like me...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) someone like me... somebody...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) [wha-ah-ah]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I'm ready now, I'm ready now
                    F#m                    B
I'm ready now, I'm ready now I'm ready now)
