A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
E                                   A             B
I sit and wait Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know The places where we go When we're grey and old

               F#m           A                C#m           A
'Cos I've been told That salvation lets their wings unfold

PRE-CHORUS
            D                        A
So when I'm lying in my bed Thoughts running through my head
      E                      D         A            E
And I feel that love is dead I'm loving angels instead


CHORUS
              B                   C#m
And through it all she offers me protection
                  A                              E
A lot of love and affection Whether I'm right or wrong
              B                        C#m
And down the waterfall Wherever it may take me
                      A                        Abm
I know that life won't break me When I come to call  
           F#m        D         A       E
she won't forsake me I'm loving angels instead

VERSE
When I'm feeling weak And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above And I know I'll always be blessed with love

PRE-CHORUS
And as the feeling grows She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead I'm loving angels instead
