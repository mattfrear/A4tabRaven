Bryan Adams - Heaven
A4 tab from http://www.a4tab.net

[C]Oh, [Am]thinking about all our [G]younger years
There was [Dm]only you and [Am]me,
we were [Bb]young and wild and [G]free

[C]Now, [Am]nothing can take you a[G]way from me
We've been [Dm]down that road be[Am]fore
But that's [Bb]over now, you keep me [G]comin' back for more

{start_of_chorus}
[F]Baby you're [G]all that I [Am]want
When you're [C]lying here in my [F]arms
[F]I'm finding it [G]hard to be[Am]lieve we're in [G]heaven

[F]And love is [G]all that I [Am]need
And I [C]found it here in your [F]heart
[F]It isn't too [G]hard to [Am]see we're in [G]heaven

[C]Oh, [Am]once in your life you [G]find someone
Who will [Dm]turn your world a[Am]round
Bring you [Bb]up when you're feeling [G]down

[C]Yeah, [Am]nothing could change what you [G]mean to me
Oh there's [Dm]lots that I could [Am]say
But just [Bb]hold me now, 'cause our [G]love will light the way

chorus

[Dm]I've been waiting for so [F]long
For something to [C]arrive
For love to come a[G]long

[Dm]Now our dreams are coming [F]true
Through the good times and the [C]bad
Yeah, I'll be [G]standing there by you
