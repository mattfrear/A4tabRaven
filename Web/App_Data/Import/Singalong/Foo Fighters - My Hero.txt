VERSE (play intro chords)
Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

   There goes my hero         
(D#5  E5        C#5)        E  (D#5 E5 F#5)  E  (D#5 E5 B5)
     Watch him as he goes
     
   There goes my hero
      He's ordinary

VERSE
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE
Kudos my hero leaving all the best
You know my hero, the one that's on

REPEAT CHORUS
