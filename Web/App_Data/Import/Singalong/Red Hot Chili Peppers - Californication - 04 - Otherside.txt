CHORUS - first time, no chords, just intro
Am          F             C
How long how long  will I slide
G           Am    
Separate my side   I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat It's all I ever

VERSE
Am                                Em
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
             G                  A
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me, A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
             G                  A
I've got to take it on the otherside
G                  A
Take it on the otherside
G              A
Take it on    Take it on

REPEAT CHORUS

Pour my life into a paper cup, The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut, I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed, A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread, I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside, Take it on     Take it on

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE

Em
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
  C
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down And then it's born again
