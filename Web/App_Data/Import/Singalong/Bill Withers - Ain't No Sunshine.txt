A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
                           Am      Em   G   Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
                              Em
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                       Dm                     Am
And she always gone too long anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where shes gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away 

CHORUS
Am
And I know I know I know I know etc
           Em
I ought to leave the young thing alone
          Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Any time she goes away

Any time she goes away x3
