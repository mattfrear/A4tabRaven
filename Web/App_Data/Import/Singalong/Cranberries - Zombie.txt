CRANBERRIES - ZOMBIE
A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE 
Em      C                G              D/F#
Another head hangs lowly Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence Who are we mistaken
May you see, it's not me it's not my family
in your head, in your head they're fighting

With their tanks, and their bombs and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head They're crying

CHORUS
In your head, in your head Zombie, Zombie, Zombie eh eh eh
What's in your head, in your head Zombie Zombie Zombie eh eh eh oh

Another mother's breaking heart is taken over
And the violence causes silence we must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916 in your head, 
in your head they're still fighting 

With their tanks, and their bombs and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head They're dying

REPEAT CHORUS
