INTRO
La la la la la la la la la la ...

VERSE 1
Am            D7                  G
Now that i've lost every thing to you
            Cmaj7                  F
You say you wanna start something new
         Dm                       E
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving Baby I'm grieving

VERSE 2
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
           Dm                          E   G7
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

CHORUS
C   G                Am   F
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
G                F             C
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
G                F              C           D  E
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

VERSE 3
You know i've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never want to see you sad girl Don't be a bad girl

VERSE 4
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember theres a lot of bad everywhere
