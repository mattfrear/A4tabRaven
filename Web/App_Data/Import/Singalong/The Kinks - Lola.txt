C  D  E

I met her in a club down in old Soho
            A                      D                A     E
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry Cola
          A  Asus
C-O-L-A Cola
      E
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
    A                          D                    A    E
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
          A   D            C  D  E
L-O-L-A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she sqeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

CHORUS #1:
          B
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
F#m                             A
Under electric candlelight She picked me up and sat me on her knee
                                B7
And said "Dear boy, won't you come home with me?"

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola

BRIDGE
    A     C#m  B       A     C#m    B
I pushed her away, I walked to the door
   A    C#m    B            E   G#m    C#m
I fell to the floor, I got down on my knees
      B
Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girl will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola

CHORUS #2:
Well I left home just a week before, And I'd never ever kissed a woman 
before, But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man"

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad that I'm a man, And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
