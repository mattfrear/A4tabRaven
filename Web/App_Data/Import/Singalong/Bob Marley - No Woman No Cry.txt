CHORUS
C   C/B     Am    F 
No woman no cry  
 C  F        C     G
No woman no cry

VERSE
C       C/B     Am              F
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown.
Oba, Observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we had oh good friends we've lost
along the way
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say        And

CHORUS
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Here Little darlin' don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown.
And then Georgie would make a firelight
As it was love would burn in through the night.
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
of which I'll share with you.
My feet is my only carriage
So, I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone
Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright. Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.
Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright. Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.

REPEAT CHORUS (Here Little sister, don't shed no tears)

REPEAT SECOND VERSE

REPEAT CHORUS (Oh, my Little darlin', don't shed no tears)
