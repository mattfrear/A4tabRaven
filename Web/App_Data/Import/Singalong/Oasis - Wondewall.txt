OASIS - WONDERWALL

Capo 2nd fret

VERSE

Em7        G		 		 Dsus4			A7sus4
  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
  By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
	  Cadd9	   Dsus4    A7sus4 
About you now

   Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
   I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do 
about you now


PRE-CHORUS
    Cadd9            Dsus4	      Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I 
      G       Dsus4/F#  Em7        G         A7sus4
would like to say to    you but I don't know how

Chorus
------
	Cadd9  Em7   G    Em7   		     Cadd9    Em7   G
Because maybe	        You're gonna be the one that saves me
   Em7       Cadd9   Em7   G         Em7          Cadd9  Em7   G  Em7
And after all		     You're my wonderwall

(hold Em7, then silence)

drums come in, then:

G

VERSE

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
