        Dm  Bb  C

VERSE
A  C  C#m                            G#
      What will you do when you get lonely?
C#m    C       D       E   E7
No one waiting by your side.
F#m             B        E           A
You've been runnin', hidin' much too long.
F#m               B                 E     A
You know it's just your foolish pride.


CHORUS
 Dm    Bb     C            Dm
Layla,    you got me on my knees, Layla,
I beg you darlin' please, Layla,
Darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.


Tried to give you consolation.
Your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you.
Turned my whole world upside down.

REPEAT CHORUS

Make the best of situation.
'Fore I finally go insane.
Please don't say, we'll never find a way.
Tell me all my love's in vain.


REPEAT CHORUS x2

SOLO
