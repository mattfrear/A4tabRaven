VERSE 
F                     C  
Hey Jude dont make it bad
            C7sus4   C7      F
Take a sad song and make it better
  Bb                          F    
Remember to let her into your heart 
                  C7               F
and then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude dont be afraid 
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

CHORUS
F                        Bb
And anytime you feel the pain 
    Bb/A    Gm         Gm7       C
hey jude refrain dont carry the world 
           F         Fmaj7 F7
upon your shoulders

For now you know that its a fool 
who plays it cool by making his world  
a little colder

    F6 F7     C  Csus4  CaddG
Da da da da   Da da da da  Da
 
Hey Jude dont let me down 
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into you heart 
then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in 
Hey Jude begin your waiting for someone to 
perform with

And dont you know that its just you 
Hey jude you'll do the movement you need 
is on your shoulders

Da da da da  Da da da da  Da
