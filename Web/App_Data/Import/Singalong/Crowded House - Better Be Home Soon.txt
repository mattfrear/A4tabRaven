CROWDED HOUSE - BETTER BE HOME SOON
A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE 
C               Am                      Em7     G
somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you
and it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever

CHORUS
           C     C7                      F
I know I'm right , for the first time in my life
             G                         C        G
that's why I tell you: you'd better be home soon

stripping back the coats of lies and deception 
back to nothingness, like a week in the desert

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Bb           D                      G
so don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
Bb                      A7               D
cause when you get back home maybe I'll be gone

INSTRUMENTAL
C  Am   Em    G
C  Am   Em   

  F                         Bb
(when the lights go out ... on and they're crowding in)

VERSE
it would cause me pain if we were to end it
but I could start again, you can depend on it

REPEAT CHORUS:

I know I'm right , for the first time in my life
             G                         Am7  D
that's why I tell you: you'd better be home soon

OUTRO
             F    G                         C
that's why I tell you: you'd better be home soon
