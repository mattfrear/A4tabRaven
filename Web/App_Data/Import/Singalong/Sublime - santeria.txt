Verse 1:
             E                        Ab

     Dbm                            B
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all

If I could find that Heina and that Sancho she's found

CHORUS

And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I've got something for his punk ass

REPEAT CHORUS
