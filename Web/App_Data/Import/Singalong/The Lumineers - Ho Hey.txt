THE LUMINEERS - HO HEY

INTRO
C        F C

VERSE
C                               F C
I've been trying to do it right
I've been living the lonely life
I've been sleeping here instead
I've been sleeping in my bed
Am                   G       C
I've been sleeping in my bed

So show me family
And all the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song.

CHORUS
              Am                  G                   C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
              Am                  G                   C
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet

VERSE
I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might've been if you
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standing on Canal...and Bowery
And she'd be standing next to me

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
      F      G
And love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
Cuz oh, we're bleeding out

REPEAT CHORUS
