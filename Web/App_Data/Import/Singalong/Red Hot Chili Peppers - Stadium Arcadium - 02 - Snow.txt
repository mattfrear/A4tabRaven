RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - SNOW (HEY OH)
A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

Capo 4th fret

Em                     C                       G                D
Come to decide that the things that I tried Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone come get a little known But I need more than myself this time

Step from the road to the sea to the sky And I do believe it we rely on
When I lay it on Come get to play it on All my life to sacrifice

CHORUS
Hey oh, Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh, Now listen what I say, oh

When will I know that I really can't go To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need All that I need to look inside

REPEAT CHORUS

INTERLUDE
C
The more I see The less I know The more I like to let it go
Em       C
Hey   oh…

BRIDGE
G                         D
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Am
Where it's so white as snow
G                      D
Privately divided by a work so undecided
              Am  
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through a field where all my tracks will be concealed
and there's nowhere to go - Oh!

VERSE
When to descend to amend for a friend All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road to the sea to the sky And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on All my life to sacrifice

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT INTERLUDE

REPEAT BRIDGE

I said hey, hey yeah, oh yeah, tell my Love now
Hey, hey yeah, oh yeah, tell my Love now

REPEAT BRIDGE

I said hey, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey yeah, oh yeah
