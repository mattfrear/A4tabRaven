EAGLE-EYE CHERRY - SAVE TONIGHT
A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

INTRO
do do do

VERSE
Am            F     C     G
Darling close the curtains 
'Cause all we need is candlelight 
You and me and a bottle of wine 
And I'll hold you tonight 

Well we know I'm going away 
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so 
So take this wine and drink with me 
Let's delay our misery 

CHORUS
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone 
Save tonight, and fight the break of dawn 
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone 

There's a log on the fire 
And it burns like me for you 
Tomorrow comes with one desire 
To take me away 

It ain't easy to say goodbye 
Darling please don't start to cry 
'Cause girl you know I've got to go 
Lord I wish it wasn't so 

REPEAT CHORUS

SOLO (REPEAT CHORUS CHORDS)

Tomorrow comes to take me away 
I wish that I, that I could stay 
But girl you know I've got to go 
And Lord I wish it wasn't so 

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT SOLO TO FADE
