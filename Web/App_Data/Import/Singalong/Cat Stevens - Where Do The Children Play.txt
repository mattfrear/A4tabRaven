INTRO (PLAY VERSE, PRECHORUS, VERSE)

VERSE
          D         G6          D       G6
Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Yes, get what you want to if you want 'cos you can get anything

CHORUS
 Em7          Asus2             Em7            A
I know we've come a long way, we're changing day to day
 Em7           A                     D   G6
But tell me, where do the children play?

VERSE
Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass 
For your lorryloads pumping petrol gas 
And you make them long, and you make them tough

PRECHORUS
           C            C/B                   C         C/B
But they just go on and on, and it seems you can't get off 

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT INTRO

VERSE
When you crack the sky, scrapers fill the air 
Will you keep on building higher 
'til there's no more room up there?

PRECHORUS
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

REPEAT CHORUS (loudly)

OUTRO
Do doot do, do de do doot do
Do de do doot do do de do do
