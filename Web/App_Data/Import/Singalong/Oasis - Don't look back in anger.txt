OASIS - DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER
A4 tab by Matt Frear www.a4tab.net

VERSE
C               G               Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F     G
Don't you know you might find
                    C     Am G
A better place to play

You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen Slowly fade away

PRE-CHORUS
F            Fm                 C
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
G#/E7
Take that look from off your face
Am                 G                F             G
Cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut

CHORUS
C   G        Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C    Am G
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I heard you say

VERSE
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock and Roll band Who'll throw it all away

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS

SOLO (play Pre-Chorus

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT HALF CHORUS, then

OUTRO 
E7                      F                  Fm
  But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger

I heard you sayâ€¦ At least not today
