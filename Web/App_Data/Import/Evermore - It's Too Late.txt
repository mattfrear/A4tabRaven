EVERMORE - IT'S TOO LATE
A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
Am              Em            Dm             Am
Monday Morning, hesitate, I can't get out of bed
I'd rather go back to the dreams living in my head
Yeah... yeah

Tuesday evening pack my bags, I'm heading out the door
I left a box of memories, lying on the floor
Yeah... yeah

CHORUS
Am       Em        Dm            Am
Ride on, ride till early morning sun
Am      Em         Dm            Am
Ride on, like the dawning of the day
          C           F                 C    B/G   
It's too late, to let all your feelings show
Am     Em      Dm       Am        
Go on, til the night is swept away

VERSE
Running from the city lights, Running from this empty life
I'm running out of time tonight, Screaming out for help! Help!

(Slow down you're moving too fast, Go home you'll feel better for it
Oh boy you better stop dreaming it's all in your head)

            F
'Cause it's too late now

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

OUTRO
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh
