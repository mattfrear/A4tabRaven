A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

B                   A  B
Bat your eyes girl, be otherworldly.
A B                  A  G      F#
Count your blessings. Seduce a stranger.

What's so wrong with being happy?
                 A E          G           F#  
Kudos to those who see through sickness. (yeah)
E F#
Over and over and over and over and ooh...

CHORUS
B        A      B        A    B
She woke in the morning.
          A        G        F#         B
She knew that her life had passed her by
               A      B        A    B
And she called out a warning:
          A   E     G        B    A
"Don't ever let life pass you by!"

I suggest we learn to love
ourselves before it's made illegal.
When will we learn? (When will we learn?)
When will we change? (When will we change?)
Just in time to see it all come down.
Those left standing will make millions
writing books on the way it should have been.

REPEAT CHORUS (end F#)
          A   E     G        F#    E  F#
"Don't ever let life pass you by!"

E  
Floating in this cosmic jacuzzi,
we are like frogs oblivious
to the water starting to boil.
No one flinches. We all float face down.

(PLAY FIRST HALF OF CHORUS WITH NO VOCALS)

She woke in the morning.
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning,
"Don't ever let life pass you by...
pass you by..."
