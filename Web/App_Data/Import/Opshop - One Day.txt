VERSE
A                 Bm         F#m    
Absence makes her heart grow fonder
            D            Bm       A
While I'm conquering the last frontier
Lately I've found myself wonderin' out loud 
Wonderin' what I was doin' here

CHORUS
    G                 D             A
One day you'll understand how much you have me
One day you'll realise we have it easy
I can't offer you the future - I don't know it myself
    Bm           G     A
All I can offer you is me
              Bm        G
I'm all I can offer you right now

VERSE
Patience makes her heart grow stronger 
Reassure her she's where I want to be
Never was the grass ever greener I'm about ready as I'll ever be

CHORUS
And one day you'll understand how much you have me
One day you'll realise we have it easy
If an expression of love is what you need to believe
All I can offer you is me
I'm all I can offer you right now

BRIDGE
C                  D
C                  D
                     I'm all I am
C                  D
                     All I am, yeah
C                  D

CHORUS
One day you'll understand how much you have me
One day you'll realise we have it easy
I can't offer you the future - I don't know it myself
All I can offer you is me

REPEAT FIRST CHORUS

[Pause]
Absence make her heart grow fonder
While I'm conquering the last frontier
