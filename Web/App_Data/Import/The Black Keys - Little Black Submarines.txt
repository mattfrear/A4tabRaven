THE BLACK KEYS - LITTLE BLACK SUBMARINES
Tabbed by: tele.kom

VERSE
Am          G            D        A 
Little black submarines Operator please
Am         G       A
Put me back on the line

Told my girl I'd be back Operator please
This is wrecking my mind

CHORUS
Am         G
Oh, can it be
    D              A
The voices calling me
A - B - C         D      A  
They get lost and out of time
  Am                G
I should've seen it glow
    D         A
But everybody knows
       C      D        A
That a broken heart is blind
A - B - C     D        A
That a broken heart is blind

VERSE
Pick you up, let you down, When I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans, But they just disappeared
To the back of my mind

REPEAT CHORUS

DISTORTED GUITAR COMES IN (Same chords as the acoustic guitar, just strum)

Treasure maps, fallen trees Operator please
Call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease Operator please
Pass me back to my mind

REPEAT CHORUS
That a broken heart is blind
