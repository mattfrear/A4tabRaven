GREEN DAY - GIVE ME NOVACAINE
Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

A                        F#m(high)
Take away the sensation inside
Bm                          E(high)
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore

CHORUS
DDDDD                      A
Drain the pressure from the swelling,
This sensations overwhelming,
D                                 F#m
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Bm                         E
Tell me that (Jimmy) I won't feel a thing
               A
So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling, that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than air, I'll tell you why

REPEAT CHORUS

           F#m
Oh Novacaine

SOLO
F#m   A
F#m   A
F#m   A
F#m   A    B     E

REPEAT CHORUS
