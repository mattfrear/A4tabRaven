A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
Am  Dm  F        (G)
Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker When you break it to show
Everything must go

BRIDGE
C                            G          F
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Am                      G           F
Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

VERSE
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cave
Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake of his soul Everything must go 
Lookin' mighty tired of All the thing that you own
Everything must go

BRIDGE
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over But it's only on the rise 
Calling calling For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

BRIDGE
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky Because I know I'm coming back

SOLO (play verse chords)

BRIDGE
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves Because there's order in the pack 
Throw me to the sky Because I know I'm coming back
