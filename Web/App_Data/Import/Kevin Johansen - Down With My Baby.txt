I'm gonna get down with my baby,
A                              C#m
and I'm gonna get down, with her soon.
D                            B
She's on her way, and I just can't wait,
G                           C
she'll be back by this afternoon, wooo

I’ve been waitin’ for this moment, baby
Knowing all along that it was goin’ to happen
Even through the moments of doubt, baby
I knew you’d come through

You owed it to yourself
You were with him for way too long
Trapped in your own fears for almost 8 years

[STRUM]

And all you had to do was wake up and walk out
‘Cause I was here, waitin’ all along
(high) And I just can't wait
And now you know

Now you know that you belong to yourself
Not to him. not to me
(high) And I just can't wait
And you chose me
Thank you
