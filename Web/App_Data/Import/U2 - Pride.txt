[Capo on 2nd fret]

 A                   D
One man come in the name of love,
 G               Em
One man come and go.
 A                   D
One come here to justify,
 G               Em
One man to overthrow,

CHORUS
 A                   D
In the name of love,
 G               Em
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love, What more in the name of love.

One man crawled on a barbed wire fence,
One man he resist.
One man washed on an empty beach.
One man betrayed with a kiss.

REPEAT CHORUS

Early morning, April 4.
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life,
But they could not take your pride.

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

oh oh oh oh 
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh 
oh oh oh oh  ... REPEAT TO FADE
