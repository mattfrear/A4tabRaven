Dm Dm/C G  (repeat over and over again)

C       C/B                 Bb       A
I never thought that I could be so bold,
Dm      Dm/C              G
to even say these thoughts aloud.
C         C/B                Bb        A
I see you with him, and your eyes just shine,
Dm       Dm/C               G
while he stands tall and walking proud.

C             C/B       Bb     A            Dm 
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Dm/C             G
Looking right at me.
C          C/B     Bb    A          Dm 
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
Dm/C              G
I'd never let you down.

It always seems like you're going somewhere,
better than you've been before.
When I go to sleep, and I dream all night,
of you knocking on my door.

That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
I'd be all I can be. I'd be all I can be.

I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much, I know it's true.
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few

That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
I'd give you all I got.

I never thought that I could be so bold,
to even say these thoughts aloud.
But if let's say, it won't work out.
You know where I can be found.

That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
I'd never let you down. I'd never let you down.
