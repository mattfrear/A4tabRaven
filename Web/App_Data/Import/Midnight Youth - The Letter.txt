VERSE
C                   Am                           F      G
Yesterday, I got a letter, from an old friend of mine.
It had some words and a picture, you had changed your life. You said that...

F                       G                F                       G
If you're the same boy I knew of, when those days slipped slowly by, 
F                       G     C  C/B   Am   G F           G
we should meet up and see if, we could be all right, this time.

VERSE
And so we talked of our stories til the sun and the waves, they turned in.
We made plans for the next year, you were on my mind, all of the time. Because 

If you're the same girl I knew of, when those days slipped slowly by, 
Well we should meet up and see if, we could be all right, this time.

CHORUS
                         F          C           G
Do you think that I will change your world if I go?
Join you on the shore with stories untold?
                            F       G       C   C/B    Am   G    F
Do you think that we could do this, living, breathing, under the sun?
          G                  C
Not on my mind, all of the time.

SOLO

If we're the same kids we knew of, when those days slipped slowly by.
Well we should meet up and see if, we could be all right this time.

REPEAT CHORUS

Oh oh oh oh ...
(Did you think that you were homeward bound? Cos I am leaving on the next plane out.
And all these stars, are they aligning now?)

OUTRO
Do you think that I will change your world if I go? 
Join you on the shores with stories untold?
Yeah we could do this, oh
