GREEN DAY - ARE WE THE WAITING
Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

A                                D
Starry nights city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown 
F#m(high)           E(high)            D
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams

CHORUS
(And screaming) Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
(And screaming) Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

Forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie 

(And screaming) Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
(And screaming) Are we we are, are we we are the waiting (unknown)

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
(And screaming) Are we we are, are we we are the waiting (unknown)
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting (unknown)
