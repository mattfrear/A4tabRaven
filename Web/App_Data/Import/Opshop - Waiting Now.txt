Opshop - Waiting Now
A4 Tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
G     Am         F
Dawn says almost everything
Passing in front of you and me Disguised as a memory
We're all guilty and under the influence - of gravity
But I'm so partial to those moments with you
Oh I'm so partial to those moments with you

Oh-woah…
Oh-woah…

I've bathed in our own lament
When we were flashing in front of my eyes and 
I and I and me are my own worst enemies
But I hope you'll see the best of us in time

CHORUS
    F       G            Am
I'm waitin' now for this cause to take effect
    F       Am      G
I'm waitin' now - I am
                  F           G       Am
And though you're standing up high on this precipice
   F        G    Am
I'm waitin' now I am
F       Am       G
Waitin' now         - I am

VERSE
G       Am         F
                      I am
I'll kneel before my, before my detriment
Before my stomach starts churning both inside and out
I've been broken down before 
And this apartment - is still a mess

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
F    G     Am  Em    F
          Woah…    woah…
          Woah…    woah…

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE
I am
I am
I am
