COLIN HAY (MEN AT WORK) - OVERKILL

INTRO
D     G     D     G
 
D5                          D5/C#
I can't get to sleep

C                      C/B
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know I'll be alright
Perhaps it's just imagination

CHORUS
B5                          Asus4  A
Day after day it reappears

B5                                        Asus4         A
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear

F#sus4         F#           G          Asus4  A
Ghosts appear and fade away    [Come back another day] <-- 2nd chorus                      

VERSE
Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation

At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
from overkill

REPEAT INTRO

VERSE (sung an octave higher)
I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know I'll be alright
It's just overkill

REPEAT CHORUS

Repeat “Ghosts appear and fade away” x3
