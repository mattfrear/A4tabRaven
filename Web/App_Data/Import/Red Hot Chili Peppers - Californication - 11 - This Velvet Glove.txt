Dm     C   Bb                  Dm      C       Bb
Close to my skin I'm falling in Someone who's been 
Sittin' by the phone I'm left alone In another zone 
John says to live above hell My will is well 
No one is waiting For me to fail My will could sail yeah 

It's such a waste to be wasted In the first place 
I want to taste the taste of Being face to face with common grace 
To meditate on the warmest dream 
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme 

CHORUS
Dm                       Am
Your solar eyes are like Nothing I have ever seen 
Somebody close That can see right through 
I'd take a fall and you know That I'd do anything 
C          Am
I will for you 

Sailin' for the sun 'Cause There is one Knows where I'm from 
I care for you I really do I really do 
Come closer now So you can lie Right by my side 
Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you Getting over myself 

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS 

Close to my skin Someone who's been I'm a falling in 
Disasters are Just another star Falling in my yard 
John says to live above hell My will is well 
Long to be with Someone to tell I love your smell
