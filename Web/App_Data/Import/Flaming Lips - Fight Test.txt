intro: A    C#m    D    E2    A    F#m    E


VERSE
                A                       C#m              D             E2          
I thought I was smart - I thought I was right I thought it better not to fight
                      A         F#m          E
I thought there was a virtue in always being cool

so when it came time to fight - I thought I'll just step aside
                              F#m            E   
and that time would prove you wrong and that you (would be the fool...)


CHORUS
I don't know where the sun beams end and the star lights begin It's all a mystery (hold E)

VERSE
Oh to fight is to defend if it's not Now than tell me when 
would be the time that you would stand up And be a man

for to lose I could accept but to surrender 
                               A      F#      E
I just wet and regretted this moment - oh that I (I Was the fool)

CHORUS
I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins it's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what right for his own life it's all a mystery (hold E)

VERSE
Cause I'm a man not a boy and there are things You can't avoid 
you have to face them when you're not prepared To face them

If I could I would but you're with him now it'd do no good
I should have fought him but instead I let him - (let Him take it)
