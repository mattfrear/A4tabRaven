CAPO 1ST FRET

VERSE
 C           G              F
Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
 F         C           G
Blue eyed girl playing in the sand

I've been on the trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand

BRIDGE
F         Am        Dm                     G
Teenage rush, She said ain't we all just runaways?
        F                  Am
We got time and that ain't much

PRE-CHORUS
          G            F
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
           G                 Am         F
You gotta know that this is real Baby, why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can't choose, Oh

VERSE
We got engaged on a Friday night, I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I've got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild

BRIDGE
It's in my blood, She said she might just runaway, Somewhere else, someplace good

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS
             G
Let's take a chance, baby we can't lose

CHORUS
                  C   G    F
Ain't we all just runaways?
                  F      C              G       C   G   F
I knew it when I met you I'm not gonna let you runaway
I knew it when I held you I wasn't letting go

            Em                       Am
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
           F
Hold each other 'till the morning light
    C                     Am
We used to laugh, now we only fight
 G                    F
Baby are you lonesome now?

VERSE
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognise the girl but I can't settle in these walls

PRE-CHORUS
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
Now we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you wanna hide it?)
   G
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive 

REPEAT CHORUS

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeeeaah, runaways (Ain't we all just runaways?)
Yeeeaah

OUTRO
G Am F
