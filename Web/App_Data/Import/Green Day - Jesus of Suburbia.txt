Part I: Jesus Of Suburbia (4/4)
-------------------------------
VERSE 1
-------
C#                                A#
    I'm the son of rage and love       The Jesus of Suburbia
    F#                               G#
The bible of none of the above, on a steady diet of
C#                                A#
    Soda pop and Ritalin               No one ever died for my
F#                                               G#
Sins in Hell, as far as I can tell, at least the ones I got away with

CHORUS
------
            F#                  G#           F#                  G#
And there's nothing wrong with me,   this is how I'm supposed to be
     F#              G#                             C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#
In a land of make believe that don't believe in me

VERSE 2
-------
    Get my television fix,        sitting on my crucifix
A living room on my private womb, while the moms and brads are away
    To fall in love and fall in debt       to alcohol and cigarettes
And mary jane to keep me insane, doing someone else's cocaine

REPEAT CHORUS

C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#
C#  A#  F#  G#
C#  F   A#  G#  F#  G#

Part II: City Of The Damned (4/4)
---------------------------------
VERSE 1 (some chords are arranged for guitar from piano)
-------
       C#                         C                  A#        G#
At the center of the Earth in the parking lot of the 7-11 were I was taught
F#                      G#
    The motto was just a lie
        C#                               C                    A#                       G#
It says home is where your heart is, but what a shame, 'cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
F#                      G#
    It's beating out of time

CHORUS
------
A#         G#         C#                 F#
    City of the Dead,      at the end of another lost highway
A#           G#              F#
    Signs misleading to nowhere
    City of the damned,    lost children with dirty faces today
    No one really seems to care

VERSE 2 (same as first)
-----------------------
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
    And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed that the center of the earth is the end of the world
    And I could really care less

REPEAT CHORUS

Part III: I Don't Care (3/3 turning into 4/4)
---------------------------------------------
G#  C#  G#  C#  F#  C#

G#           C#            G#           C#            F#           C#           G#
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't care
F#  G#    C#    A  G#  C#  A  G#  C#  A  G#  C#  A  G#
I   don't care

                      A  G#
Everyone's so full of shit
                       A  G#
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

F#           G#      C#  G#
Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe
F#           G#          F#  G#    C#
And I don't believe, and I   don't care
F#  G#    C#    F#  G#    C#
I   don't care, I   don't care
F#  G#    C#    F#  G#    C#  C#  C#  C#  G#
I   don't care, I   don't care

Part IV: Dearly Beloved (4/4)
-----------------------------
G#                    Cm
   Dearly beloved are you listening?
  C#                                  G#     D#
I can't remember a word that you were saying
   Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

G#  Cm  C#  G#  D#

   Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
   Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

G#  C  C#  G#  D#

Part V: Tales Of Another Broken Home (4/4)
------------------------------------------
G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#

C# G#       F#  C# G#       F# C# G#     F# C# G#  F#
To live and not to breathe, is to die in trage-dy
C# G#      F#  C# G# F# C# G#        F#  C# G#   F#
To run, to run aw-ay,   to find what you believe

    C# G# C# G# C#    G#   D# G#2 D# G#2 D# G#2
And I           leave behind
C#   G#   C#  G#  C# G#   D# G#2 D# G#2 D# G#2
This hurricane of fucking lies

I  lost my faith to this,  this town that don't ex-ist
So I  run, I run aw-ay,   the light of mas-o-chist

And I           leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I               walked this line
A million and one fucking times
    F#   C#   G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#
But not this time

F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#
F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#
C# G# C# G# C# G# D# G#2 D# G#2 D# G#2
C# G# C# G# C# G# D# G#2 D# G#2 D# G#2

C#             D#           G#         C#
  I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
   When there ain't nowhere you can go
   Running away from pain when you've been victimized
   Tales from another broken home

       F#  C#  G#
You're leaving
       F#  C#  G#
You're leaving
You're leaving
Ah, you're leaving home

F#  C#  G#  F#  C#  G#
