Jemaine:
How 'bout him in the nude, If thats what you're into
In the nude in front of you, Is that what you'd wanna view

Bret:
If it's cool with you, I'll let you get naked too
It could be a dream come true, providing that's what you are into

Jemaine:
Is that what you're into, him and you in the nude
That's what he's prepared to do, 
Is that the kinda thing that you think you might be into

Bret:
And then maybe later, we'll get hot by the refrigerator
In the kitchen next to the pantry, You think that might be what you fancy?

Jemaine:

Getting lewd with his food, We heard that's what you are into

Bret:

Jemaine:

Bein' lewd with two dudes with food, Well thats if Stu's into it too

Bret:

If I only knew, thats what your into.
