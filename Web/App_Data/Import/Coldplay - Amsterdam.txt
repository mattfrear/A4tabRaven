COLDPLAY - AMSTERDAM
A4 Tab by Matt Frear www.a4tab.net

This song doesn't have any guitar, it's all piano,
but these are the chords you can play.
Lyrics in "quotes" are in falsetto

Capo 1st fret

VERSE
D    A      Em           G  
Come on, oh my star is fading; And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited I'd not be stuck here in this hole

"Come here", oh my star is fading; And "I swerve" out of control
And "I swear" I waited and waited; "I've got to get out" of this hole

CHORUS
E                      G
But "time" is on your "side"
               D     A
It's on your "side" now
Not pushing you "down" and all "around"
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading; And "I see" no chance of release
And "I know" I'm dead on the surface But "I am screaming" underneath

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE (same chords as chorus)
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain; 
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose;
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge Tied to a noose
And you came along And you cut me loose

You came along And you cut me loose
You came along And you cut me loose
