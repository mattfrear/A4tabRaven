A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

Capo 1st fret

VERSE
E                            A
Drinking in the morning sun, blinking in the morning sun
	B                               A
Shaking off the heavy one, yeah heavy like a loaded gun
	E                             A
What made me behave that way? Using words i never say
	      A
I can only think it must be love
	   A                                      E (stop) E (stop)
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day_________

Someone tell me how I feel, it's silly wrong but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal, yeah kiss me like we die tonight
Cause holy cow i love your eyes and only now i see the light
Yeah lying with you half awake
Oh anyway it's looking like a beautiful day_________
	
When my face is chamois creased
If you think i winked I did
laugh politely at repeats
Yeah kiss me when my lips are thin
Cause holy cow i love your eyes and only now i see the light
Yeah lying with you half awake, stumbling over what to say
Well anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day_________

CHORUS
   E                     Dsus2
So throw those curtains wide
	    A                                E
One day like this a year, it'd see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year, it'd see me right

Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year, it'd see me right, for life
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year, it'd see me right, for life

Holy cow i love your eyes____ and only now i see the light____
Holy cow i love your eyes____ and only now i see the light____
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year, it'd see me right

REPEAT CHORUS
