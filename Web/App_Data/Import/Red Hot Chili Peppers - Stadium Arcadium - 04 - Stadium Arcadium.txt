VERSE
F#m                                A
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
  F#m                             A               E
I hope I get what you deserve and this is where I find

Smoke surround your perfect face and I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space and this is where I find a way

CHORUS

    Bm                 D
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)
          A
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
    E
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Bm
Stranger things have happened both
  D
Before and afternoon (before and afternoon)
          A
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
E                                           F#m
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking...now

VERSE
Alone inside my forest room and it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom but this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays For the all night crowd that it cannot phase and I'm calling
Tedious weeds that the media breeds But the animal gets what the animal needs And I'm sorry

REPEAT CHORUS

SOLO

    A               E
And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
Kind enough to disavow and this is where I stand

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS, but end on "to you"
