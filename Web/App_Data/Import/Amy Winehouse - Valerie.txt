VERSE
         D#maj7                                           Fm7 
Well sometimes i go out by myself and i look across the water
And I think of all the things, What you're doing 
and in my head i make a picture
 
CHORUS
      G# (high)                                Gm7 (high)
Cos since i've come on home , well my body's been a mess
And i've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress 
           G#             Gm7                   A#7
Won't you come on over stop making a fool out of me
                            D#maj7     Fm7
Why won't you come on over Valerie? Valerie?
Valerie... Valerie

VERSE 2

Did you have to go to jail, put your house up for sale, 
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didnt catch a tan I hope you find the right man 
who'll fix it for ya
Are you shoppin' anywhere, Changed the colour of your hair,
are you busy? 
And did you have to pay the fine you were dodging all the time
are you still dizzy?
