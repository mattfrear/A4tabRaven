CAKE - I WILL SURVIVE
A4 Tab by Matt Frear www.a4tab.net

   Am			Dm
At first I was afraid I was petrified,
                  G     				        C
I kept thinking I could never lived without you by my side,
                  F				B
but then I spent so many nights thinking how you’ve done me wrong.
           E			
I grew strong. I learned how to get along.

So you’re back from outer space. 
I just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock,
I would have made you leave your key 
If I had known for just one second you be back to bother me.

CHORUS

Oh now go walk out the door
Just turn around you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire
Did ya think I'd crumble
Did ya think I'd lay down and die

Oh not I, I will survive
Yeah as long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my live to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive I will survive yeah yeah

SOLO

It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
Oh I spent so many nights Feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you'll see me with somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free but now I'm saving
All my loving for someone who's loving me

REPEAT CHORUS
