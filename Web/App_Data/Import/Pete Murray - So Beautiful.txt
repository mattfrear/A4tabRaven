VERSE
Em
Found myself just the other day
Asus4                Csus2                   Asus2
in the backyard of a friends place, thinking about you
thinking of the crowd you're in
what you're up to where you've been, just thinking

you know the clothes that you wear
and the colour in your hair, shouldn't change you
now you tell me why is it so
you're bigger than mighty joe, at least you think so

CHORUS
Em    Am  Asus2 Am       D      
          God my fingers burn
   Dsus2 D   C         D          Em
now when i think of touching your hair

you have changed so much that I don't know
if I can call you and tell you I care
and I would love to bring you down
plant your feet back on the ground

POST CHORUS:    Em       Asus2/Am                           

VERSE
threw a smoke down on the ground
turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
of the days so young and sweet
always so much fun to me, at least I thought so
and now you think you're so damn fine
you can rule the world no not mine, I don't think so 

REPEAT CHORUS

PLAY CHORUS CHORDS FOR BREAK

you know the scene that you're in
and the people that you've been with, just get to me
but you think I'm not as cool
as you are so beautiful, who you fooling?
well I'm here to tell you babe
the game you're in in just a game, so damn pretentious

REPEAT CHORUS

you think you're so beautiful, so beautiful
