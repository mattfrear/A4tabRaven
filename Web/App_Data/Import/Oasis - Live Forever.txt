OASIS - LIVE FOREVER

VERSE
G	       D	         Am7
Maybe, I don't really wanna know How your garden grows
C	     D
I just wanna fly

Lately, did you ever feel the pain in the morning rain
as it soaks it to the bone

CHORUS
Em7		     D
  Maybe I just wanna fly
			   Am7
Wanna live I don't wanna die
		   C
Maybe I just wanna breathe
      D		      Em
Maybe I just don't believe
			 D
Maybe you're the same as me
			    Am7
We see things they'll never see
			    Fadd9
You and I are gonna live forever

REPEAT VERSE ONE

CHORUS
Em7                D
Maybe i will never be
                        Am7
all the things i want to be
                        C
but now is not the time to cry
       D                   Em
now's the time to find out why.
                           D
i think you're the same as me
                            Am7
we see things they'll never see
                            Fadd9
you and i are gonna live forever.
