VERSE
C5                 G5
There's a fire starting in my heart
A#5                          G5                       A#5 
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And its bring me out the dark

PRE-CHORUS
Ab5          Bb5                G5
The scars of your love remind me of us
              Ab5
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

CHORUS
G5                   C5      Bb5                 Ab5          Bb5
We could have had it aaaaaaaaaall Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it To the beat
(CHORUS BACKING VOCALS)
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me, 
tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

VERSE
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there As mine sure won't be shared

REPEAT PRECHORUS (with chorus backing vocals)
REPEAT CHORUS

KEY CHANGE
Bb5                  Ab5      Bb5                C5    Bb5
We could have had it aaaaaaaaaall Rolling in the deeeeeep
                    Ab5                       Bb5
You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it with a beating

VERSE (no chords, clapping)
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(CHORUS CHORDS with backing vocals)
We could have had it all
We could have had it all It all, it all it all,

REPEAT CHORUS
REPEAT CHORUS
But you played it you played it you played it you played it to the beat
