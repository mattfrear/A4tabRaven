A4 tab by Matt Frear www.a4tab.net
Capo 1st fret

C G Em Em  4x

VERSE
C                    G         Em          C     G       Em
It's looking like a limb torn off, or altogether.. just taken apart
We're reeling through an endless fall We are the ever-living 
ghost of what once was

PRE-CHORUS
     F	     Dm             C                 G
But no one.. is ever gonna love you more than I do
F	             C                G
No one's gonna love you more than I do

VERSE
And anything to make you smile,  It is a better side.. of you to admire
But they should never take so long, Just to be over them.. 
back to another one

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS
Em                        F         G
But someone, They coulda warned you
       C                            Em          
When things start splitting at the seams to know
F                  G
The whole thing's tumbling down
C		                          Em            F  G
Things start splitting at the seams to know

C                                 Em
If things start splitting at the seams to know,
F              G    C    Em  F  G
It's tumbling down hard

VERSE
And anything to make you smile, you are the ever-living ghost of.. 
what once was
Never want to hear you say, That you’ll be better off.. 
and you like it that way

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS
