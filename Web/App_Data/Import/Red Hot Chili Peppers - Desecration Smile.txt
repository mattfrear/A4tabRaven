A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

INTRO
C#m      E  E/F# x2, Em       D  C  x2

VERSE
Em            D    C
All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else and a 
('nother girl bad for my health)

Celebrated but undisturbed  [la la la la la la...] 
serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and its never heard I'm
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

CHORUS
      D            A            E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  [na na na na na...]
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love i made is the shape of my space
My face my face

VERSE
Disintegrated by the rising sun, A rolling black out of oblivion And I 
like to think that i'm your number one A (rolling black out of oblivion)

I wanna leave but i just get stuck, A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck and I'm, 
(a broken record runnin' low on luck)

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
C D | E  Esus4 | C D | E  Esus4
C         D               E          Esus4          E
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice She enjoys
We could all come up with Something new to be destroyed
C            D   Em
We could all go down

Em | D C | Em | D C

I love feeling when it falls apart, I'm slow to finish but i'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark And I'm, (Slow to finish but i am quick to start)

REPEAT CHORUS TWICE - yeah

REPEAT START OF INTRO end on E
