VERSE
             G         D         C        D
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's taken all that I had
But, if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby I'll try to love again but I know

CHORUS

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
When it comes to being lucky she's cursed
When it comes to loving me she's worse
But when it comes to being loved she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
And, if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby I'll try to love again but I know

REPEAT CHORUS
