INTRO
D E                   D E  C D     D  E      D E   C D
     Hey hey hey hey      Ooh ooh ooh  Oh

VERSE
E              D 
Won't you come see about me?
A             D
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and

Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

CHORUS
E         D            A     D
Don't You Forget About Me    Don't Don't Don't Don't
E         D            A 
Don't You Forget About Me

BRIDGE
C                        G
Will you stand above me? Look my way, never love me
D                                     A
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling Down, down, down
Will you recognise me? Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling Down, down, down, down

REPEAT INTRO 

VERSE
Don't you try to pretend It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses Vanity and security

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

REPEAT CHORUS

D              E               D               A       
As you walk on by              Will you call my name?
As you walk on by              Will you call my name?
When you walk away
(QUIETLY)
Or will you walk away?
Will you walk on by?                          Come on - call my name
              Will you call my name?

OUTRO
