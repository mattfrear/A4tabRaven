RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - DANI CALIFORNIA
A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

VERSE
Am                  G     
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Dm                  Am
Papa was a copper and Mama was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer,
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana, 
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner 
On her merry way sayin', "Baby whatcha gonna?"

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal .45 
Just another way to survive

CHORUS
F          C       Dm    G
California rest in peace 
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess; I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

VERSE
She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California,
The day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Bm           G     F#
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Bm
Too true to say, say, say

VERSE
Push the fader, gifted animator,
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Em
Gone too fast

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS
