                 C#m                         A
I've got another confession to make I'm your fool
                 C#m                         A
Everyone's got their chains to break Holdin' you
                 B                A
Were you born to resist or be abused?

CHORUS
                      C#m                  B                  A
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and onto someone new?

VERSE
I needed somewhere to hang my head Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have But had no use
I was too weak to give in Too strong to lose

My heart is under arrest again But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in I refuse

CHORUS w/ BREAKDOWN
                      C#m                  B                  A    F#m
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith? Its real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? Oh...

BRIDGE
B     A
Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh...

CHORUS
                       C#m                     B
Has someone taken your faith? Its real, the pain you feel
   A                     F#m
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts Your trust, you must Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? Oh..

VERSE
I've got another confession my friend I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again Somewhere new 
Were you born to resist or be abused?

I swear I'll never give in I refuse

REPEAT CHORUS w/ BREAKDOWN
