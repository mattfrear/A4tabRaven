RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - TEAR
A4 tab by Matt Frear http://www.a4tab.net

(Bar chords)
C          G              Am
This is my time This is my tear
I can see clearly now That this is not a place For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time This is my tear
Comin' on strong Baudelaire
Seems to me like All the world gets high When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime

CHORUS
C      C/B     Am           G                 F                 Em
All in all I'm Loving every rise and fall The sun will make and I will take
F             G
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then All will be forgiven when Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Am
Say it now because you never know

VERSE
Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream And now I know just why When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time

California skies Got room to spare
This is my time

VERSE
Take it outside Take it out there
Seems to me like All the world gets high When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time

REPEAT CHORUS

oh, never know
