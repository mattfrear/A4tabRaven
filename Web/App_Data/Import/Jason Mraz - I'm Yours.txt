Capo on 2nd. 

       A
Well, you dawned on me and you bet I felt it 
   E 
I tried to be chill but your so hot that I melted 
   F#m
I fell right through the cracks, 
D
now I'm tryin to get back 

before the cool done run out I'll be givin it my bestest 
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention 
I reckon it's again my turn 
to win some or learn some 

CHORUS
But I wont hesitate No more, No more It can not wait; I'm Yours

(Hmmm mm hmm mmmmm)

VERSE
Well open up your mind and see like me 
open up your plans and damn you're free 
look into your heart and you'll find 
love love love love 

listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family
                                                              B7
And it's our godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved 

CHORUS 2
So, i won't hesitate  no more, no more, it cannot wait i'm sure 
there's no need to complicate our time is short 
this is your fate I'm yours 

BRIDGE
A            E    F#m        
Do do do do do do do do do do you want to come on 
E                     D                     B7
scooch on over closer dear, and I will nibble your ear

Woah woah woah oh oh oh oh oh oh hmmm

VERSE
I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror 
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer 
But my breath fogged up the glass; 
and so I drew a new face and I laughed 

I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason 
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons 
it's what we aim to do; our name is our virtue 

CHORUS (no strum)
But I won't hesitate no more, no more it cannot wait I'm yours 

REPEAT CHORUS 2, with these lyrics overlayed
Well open up your mind and see like me 
open up your plans and damn you're free 
look into your heart and you will find that the sky is yours 
so please don't, please don't, please don't, 
there's no need to complicate, 
Cause our time is short 
This, this, this is our fate, 
     D  B7
I'm yours
