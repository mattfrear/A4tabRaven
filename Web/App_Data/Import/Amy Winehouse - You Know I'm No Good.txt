VERSE
Dm                          Gm   
 Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt,   
     A7                          Dm   
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt.   
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt,
Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt,
You say "what did you do with him today?",
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray,

Gm    
  'Cause you're my fella, my guy    
E7    
  Hand me your Stella and fly    
F    
By the time I'm out the door,    
    E7                A7   
You tear men down like Roger Moore

CHORUS
	Dm                Am    
	  I cheated myself,    
                E7    Am    
	Like I knew I would,				   
	  Dm              Am   
	I told you, I was trouble,   
	    E7               Am  			   
	You know that I'm no good.

VERSE
Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy, He's in a place, but I can't get joy,
Thinking on you in the final throes, This is when my buzzer goes,
Run out to meet you, chips and pita, You say "when we married", cos you're not bitter,
"There'll be none of him no more," I cried for you on the kitchen floor,   

REPEAT CHORUS

SOLO
Dm Am E7 Am (2X)

D|-7-10-7-----|-----10-7~~-|-7-10-7-----|-----10-7~~-|

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain, We're like how we were again,
I'm in the tub, you on the seat, Lick your lips as I soak my feet,
Then you notice little carpet burn, My stomach drops and my guts churn,
You shrug and it's the worst, Who truly stuck the knife in first

REPEAT CHORUS x2
