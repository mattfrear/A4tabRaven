VERSE 1
         G              Bm7             C                 Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
             G                 Em
You're still young that's your fault
           Am               Am7 D
there's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down, if you want to, you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

I was once like you are now, and I know that its not easy
to be calm, when you've found something going on

But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
             G               Em               D          G
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

REPEAT INTRO RIFF

How can I try to explain?  when I do he turns away again
it's always been the same, same old story

From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
now there's a way and I know I have to go away
      D      C       G 
and I know I have to go

REPEAT INTRO RIFF

SOLO

It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have
to go through

Find a girl, settle down, if you want to you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away

I know I have to go
