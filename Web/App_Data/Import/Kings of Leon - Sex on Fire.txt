VERSE
E                     
Lay where you're laying Don't make a sound 
             C#m  
I know they're watching They're watching

All the commotion "The kiddie-like play" 
Has people talking Talking

CHORUS
E                C#m
You Your sex is on fire

VERSE
Dark of the alley The breaking of day 
Head while I'm driving I'm driving

Soft lips are open Them knuckles are pale 
Feels like you're dying You're dying

CHORUS
E                  C#m    A
You Your sex is on fire 
Consumed, with what's to transpire

Hot as a fever Rattling bones 
I could just taste it Taste it

If it's not forever If it's just tonight 
Oh we're still the greatest The greatest The greatest

CHORUS
You Your sex is on fire 
E (stop)           C#m (stop)
You Your sex is on fire
E (stop)           C#m (stop)      A (stop)
Consumed, with what's to transpire

And you Your sex is on fire 
Consumed, with what's to transpire.
