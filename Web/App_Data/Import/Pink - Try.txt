 VERSE
 Bm           G              D        A
 Ever wonder about what he's doing
 How it all turned to lies
 Sometimes I think that it's better 
 To never ask why

 (Bm    G     D    A)

 CHORUS
                   G                         D
 Where there is desire  There is gonna be a flame
                    A                            Bm
 Where there is a flame Someone's bound to get burned
 But just because it burns Doesn't mean you're gonna die
 You've gotta get up and try try try
 Gotta get up and try try try
 You gotta get up and try try Try
 
 VERSE
 Funny how the heart can be deceiving
 More than just a couple times
 Why do we fall in love so easy
 Even when it's not right

 REPEAT CHORUS

 VERSE
 Ever worried that it might be ruined
 And does it make you wanna cry?
 When you're out there doing what you're doing
 Are you just getting by?
 Tell me are you just getting by by by

 REPEAT CHORUS
 
 Gotta get up and try try try
 You gotta get up and try try try
 Gotta get up and try try try
 You gotta get up and try try try
 
 VERSE
 You gotta get up and try try try
 Gotta get up and try try try
