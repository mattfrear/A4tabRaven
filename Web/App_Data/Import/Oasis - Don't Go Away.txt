OASIS - DON'T GO AWAY

VERSE
  Am              Am7              Gsus4
a cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to say
          Fadd9                Dm   Fadd9
about the things caught in my mind
and as the day was dawning my plane flew away
with all the things caught in my mind

PRE-CHORUS
Dm7/4                                Fadd9   
and i wanna be there when you're coming down
and i wanna be there when you hit the ground

CHORUS
   Gsus4       C                 C2/B                 Am7*
so don't go away, say what you say, say that you'll stay
                 G                   Fmaj7
forever and a day, in the time of my life
                 G                     Am
cos i need more time, yes i need more time
        G            Fmaj7
just to make things right

VERSE
damn my situation and the games i have to play
with all the things caught in my mind
damn my education, i can't find the words to say
with all the things caught in my mind

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Fm                        C   C2/B   Am
  me and you what's going on?
F                             Fm
all we seem to know is how to show
                      C    C2/B   Am   G   F   G
the feelings that are wrong

REPEAT CHORUS
